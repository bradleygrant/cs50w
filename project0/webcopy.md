# Fountain Pens!
### A Fun Kitschy Tagline For Thinking Up Later



## What makes fountain pens so cool?

There are many reasons!

First off, fountain pens have a **striking appearance**. No drab polyethylene Bic sticks here. Fountain pen bodies come in sleek ABS plastic, or anodized aluminum, or handstained wood, or clear acrylic &mdash; in nearly any shape and size and color combination you want. Remove the cap, and a polished metal nib gleams in the light like an unsheathed sword. If you have a flair for the dramatic, fountain pens might be right up your alley.

Fountain pens **write like no other writing instrument**. Ballpoint pens, pencils, and markers all require you to bear down on the writing surface. Fountain pens glide on top of the page, allowing you to write with an extremely light touch. Your hand can relax, giving you finer control while preventing fatigue and writer's cramp.

Fountain pens write with **line variation and shading**. Ballpoint pens are mechanical and consistent &mdash; even line, every time. *But writing is anything but mechanical.* Handwriting is flowy and organic. You lift off on the upstrokes, put a little extra pressure into the downstrokes. Fountain pen nibs tend to *flex*, so when you put more pressure, the pen lays down more ink. Now your handwriting just got more interesting. Special nibs made of soft materials (like 18kt gold) can make this effect really dramatic &mdash; *almost like writing in italics!* 

Fountain pens are **endlessly customizable** and infinitely collectible. Shape, size, length, weight, color &mdash; not to mention feed, filling mechanism, and other features &mdash; can all be mixed and matched to your preferences and taste. And with a wide selection of nib types, widths, and materials, you can customize line width and ink flow to your exact specifications. Once you experience this kind of power, you'll want to try them all!



## Why would I use a fountain pen (when I already have perfectly good ballpoint pens right here)?

- **It's a fashion statement.** Fountain pens can serve as conversation pieces or fun accessories, and the right pen in the right pocket can pull a whole outfit together. Chic, hipster, or professional: the choice is yours.
- **You'll look for excuses to write more.** You'll start carrying a day planner or a bullet journal. Maybe you'll ditch the laptop for an afternoon and go doodle under a tree. You might even write *letters* on *real stationery* and send them via *snail mail* (how quaint!)
- **Your handwriting will improve.** After all, you'll be practicing constantly. The more you write, the better it'll get.
- **Words flow right onto the page.** Creative writing has never been so easy! There's no better inspiration than quality writing instruments.
- **They're fun!** They're quirky and full of personality, just like you!
