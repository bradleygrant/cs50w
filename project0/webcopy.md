# Fountain Pens!
### A Fun Kitschy Tagline For Thinking Up Later



## What makes fountain pens so cool?

There are many reasons!

First off, fountain pens have a **striking appearance**. No drab polyethylene Bic sticks here. Fountain pen bodies come in sleek ABS plastic, or anodized aluminum, or handstained wood, or clear acrylic - in nearly any shape and size and color combination you want. Remove the cap, and a polished metal nib gleams in the light like an unsheathed sword. If you have a flair for the dramatic, fountain pens might be right up your alley.

Fountain pens **write like no other writing instrument**. Ball pens, pencils, and markers all require you to bear down on the writing surface. Fountain pens glide on top of the page, allowing you write with an extremely light touch. Your hand can relax, giving you finer control while preventing fatigue and writer's cramp.

Fountain pens write with **line variation and shading**. Most people apply a little extra pressure on the downstroke of each letter. Fountain pen nibs tend to *flex*, causing the tines to open up a little wider and making the pen lay down more ink. Special nibs made of soft materials (like gold) can make this effect really obvious. 

Fountain pens are **endlessly customizable** and infinitely collectible. Pens are available at every possible combination of features, color and price point. And with a wide selection of nib types, widths, and materials, you can customize line width and ink flow to your exact specifications. Once you experience this kind of power, you'll want to try them all!



## Why would I use a fountain pen (when I already have perfectly good ballpoint pens right here)?

- **It's a fashion statement.** Face it: you're going to be known as "that dude with the weird pen". Might as well embrace it and own it.
- **You'll look for excuses to write more.** You'll start carrying a day planner or a bullet journal. Maybe you'll ditch the laptop for an afternoon and go doodle under a tree. You might even write *letters* on *real stationery* and send them via *snail mail* (how quaint!)
- **Your handwriting will improve.** The more you write, the better it'll get.
- **Words flow right onto the page.** Creative writing has never been so easy! There's no better inspiration than quality writing instruments.
- **They're fun!** They're quirky and full of personality, just like you!
